# 04 - Filters
You're going to love this tutorial; it's all about working with filters in ag-Grid. You'll learn about different types of filters, how to use them in the UI, and how to set them programatically using the grid API and filter API.

This tutorial uses a single project called `aggr-filters` for all of the videos. You'll find the starting point code in the `starting-points` folder and the finished code in the `finished-code` folder.
