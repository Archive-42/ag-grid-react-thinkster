# 06 - Styling
This tutorial is all about styling: row styling, cell styling, grid size, using custom icons, and printing the grid.

This tutorial uses a project called `aggr-styling` for all of the videos. You'll find the starting point code in the `starting-points` folder and the finished code in the `finished-code` folder.
