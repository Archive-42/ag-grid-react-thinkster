# 02 - Working with Data
This tutorial is all about working with data in ag-Grid. I've broken the examples into 3 different sample projects. Each one has a `starting-point` repo and a `finished-code` repo.

- Use the `aggr-data` starting point and finished code for the videos on value getters and basic cell renderers.
- Use the `aggr-infinite` starting point and finished code for the video on the infinite row model.
- Use the `aggr-redux` starting point and finished code for the videos on setting up and updating ag-Grid with Redux.
