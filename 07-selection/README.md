# 07 - Selection
This tutorial is all about selection: row selection, checkbox selection, the selection API, range selection, and fill handles.

This tutorial uses a project called `aggr-selection` for all but the last two videos. You'll find the starting point code in the `starting-points` folder and the finished code in the `finished-code` folder.

The remaining two videos use StackBlitz examples:

- [Range Selection](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ag-grid-react-range-selection)
- [Fill Handle](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ag-grid-react-fill-handle)
