# 08 - Cell Editing
This tutorial is all about cell editing: starting and stopping editing, provided cell editors, undo and redo of edits, the cell editing API, and custom cell editors.

This tutorial uses a project called `aggr-cell-editing` for all of the videos. You'll find the starting point code in the `starting-points` folder and the finished code in the `finished-code` folder.
