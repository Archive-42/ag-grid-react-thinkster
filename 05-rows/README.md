# 05 - Rows
You can't have a grid without rows, right?! This tutorial covers all things rows. You'll learn about sorting, pinning, and dragging rows, as well as techniques like row spanning and full width rows. 

This tutorial uses a project called `aggr-rows` for all but the last three videos. You'll find the starting point code in the `starting-points` folder and the finished code in the `finished-code` folder.

The last three videos use StackBlitz projects:

- [Auto Row Height](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ag-grid-react-auto-row-height)
- [Row Spanning](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ag-grid-react-row-spanning)
- [Full Width Rows](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ag-grid-react-full-width-rows)
